These files should /overwrite/ their respective counterparts in the ezquake
source.

This code replaces parts of ezquakes ALSA audio driver with SDL. 

You can thus configure ezquake to use whichever sound engine SDL supports - including ALSA itself or more exotic options like pulseaudio, etc, by simply setting the s_device variable in your quake configuration.

This was written because I wanted to quickly add support for pulseaudio. Since SDL supports pulseaudio (and many other sound subsystems!) this was the easiest way to do it.

To tell SDL_Audio to use the pulseaudio driver, simply set
s_device "pulse" 
in your config.cfg.
